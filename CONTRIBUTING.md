# Contributing to BREAKPOINT

We welcome contributions from the community to improve the resilience of modern applications.

## Guidelines
1. **Focus on Attack Logic**: We welcome new attack modules and improved detection signatures.
2. **Respect the Unified Architecture**: Do not submit PRs that attempt to bypass the licensing logic or alter the runtime enforcement mechanisms.
3. **Tests Required**: Any new module must include basic verification tests.

## Security Disclosures
If you find a security vulnerability in the tool itself, please refer to [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
